Python is a dynamically typed language.

String -> Anything which is in double quotes [" "] is string.
"" -> it takes multiple values in a single line
'' -> it for characters

2. Dictionary
3. Boolean -> True, False
4. Set
5. Sequence -> List, Tuple, Strings


Operators:

Arithmetic Operators:
    Add
    Sub
    Mul
    Division - float/ floor
    Mod
    power
	
	
				7)50(0.9999   -> 0 -> // - floor divison
				  49
				------
				   1   -> % mod

Comparison Operator:
The output of a comparison operator is always boolean.

    Greater than -> >
    lesser than -> <
    double equals -> ==
    not equals -> !=
    greater than or equal -> >=
    lesser than or equal -> <=

Logical Operators:
    and   -> if both are true then O/P is true
    or    -> if anyone is true then O/P is true
    not   -> Opposite of the value

Assignment Operators:
    =
    +=  -> x += y -> x = x + y
    -=  -> y-=x   -> y = y - x
    *=
    /=
